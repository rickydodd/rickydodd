Hello, I'm @rickydodd

I'm a student of computer science at Deakin University.
I'm currently learning more about...
- Go, and how to build better microservices with Go.
- Web development with Go.
- Web development with Nodejs.

Check out [my blog](https://rickydodd.github.io/) that I created with static site generation. It's still a work-in-progress, but it's taking shape and static site generation has been fantastic for the use-case.
