Hello, I'm @rickydodd

I'm a student of computer science with a deep fascination in theory and practicality.
Currently I'm learning more about the x86-64 architecture, how to write better C and C++, and I'm also learning more about Racket (Lisp dialect).

Check out [my blog](https://rickydodd.github.io/) (created using static site generation). If you want to get a hold of me, you can e-mail me @ rickydoddmobile@gmail.com
